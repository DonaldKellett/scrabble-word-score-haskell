# scrabble-word-score-haskell

Just a simple demo of an interactive Haskell program which accepts user input and processes it with basic error handling:

- `main.hs` - The Haskell program containing the interactive Scrabble word score calculator
- `noSugar.hs` - The same program without the `do` syntactical sugar
